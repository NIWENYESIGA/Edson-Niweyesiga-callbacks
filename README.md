# Edson-Niweyesiga-callbacks
My Application has two activities ie Activity1 and Activity2. It displays personal information ie Name and registration Number and another demonstrates activity callbacks. 
The Personal Information Activity displays personal information . It contains a field for name, registration number and my photo. 
Activity2 :The user can navigate to the second activity by clicking a button provided in the first activity. Each activity represents a specific event in the lifecycle of an activity. When each callback is triggered, a Toast message is displayed on the screen to inform the user about the current state of the activity.
